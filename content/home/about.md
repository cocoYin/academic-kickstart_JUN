# Biography

Jun Yin is a research fellow working of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at Dendrite Morphogenesis and Plasticity Lab. The dendritic arbor of ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) shows remarkable change in structure and length upon light stimulation during larval development. She is identifying the novel molecules regulating the dendritic plasticity and studying how inhibitory neuronal circuits modulate this dynamic system. Uncovering the mechanisms involved in neuronal plasticity should provide more advanced understanding on memory and learning.
