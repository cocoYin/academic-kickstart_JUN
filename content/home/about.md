# Biography

Jun Yin is a research fellow working in the Dendrite Morphogenesis and Plasticity Lab at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH. The dendritic arbor of ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) shows remarkable change in structure and length upon light stimulation during larval development. She is identifying novel molecules regulating the dendritic plasticity and studing how inhibitory neuronal circuits modulate this dynamic system. Uncovering the mechanisms involved in neuronal plasticity should provide more advanced understanding on memory and learning.
